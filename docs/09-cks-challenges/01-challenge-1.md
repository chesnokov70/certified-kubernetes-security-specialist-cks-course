# CKS Challenge 1

[Take me to the lab!](https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/cks-challenges/module/624cd49b-715f-45e8-9959-372425b771a6/lesson/4e781840-cc73-46d2-8608-f4608be7f005)

Please note that the competition status for CKS Challenges is ended. Please do not submit a solution. It will not be scored.

# Challenge

There are 6 images listed in the diagram. Using `Aquasec Trivy` (which is already installed on the controlplane node), identify the image that has the least number of critical vulnerabilities and use it to deploy the `alpha-xyz` deployment.

Secure this deployment by enforcing the AppArmor profile called `custom-nginx`.

Expose this deployment with a ClusterIP type service and make sure that only incoming connections from the pod called `middleware` is accepted and everything else is rejected.

Click on each icon (in the lab) to see more details. Once done, click the Check button to test your work.

Do the tasks in this order:

1.  <details>
    <summary>namespace</summary>

    All the action is taking place in the `alpha` namespace

    ```
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace alpha
    ```

1.  <details>
    <summary>alpha-pv</summary>

    * A persistentVolume called `alpha-pv` has already been created. Do not modify it. Inspect the parameters used to create it.

    <details>
    <summary>Reveal</summary>

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pv alpha-pv
    ```

    Note `StorageClass`, `Access Modes`, `Capacity`, `VolumeMode`

    </details>
    </details>

1.  <details>
    <summary>alpha-pvc</summary>

    * `alpha-pvc` should be bound to `alpha-pv`. Delete and Re-create it if necessary.

    <details>
    <summary>Reveal</summary>

    ```
    kubectl get pvc alpha-pvc
    ```

    > Status is pending, i.e it wont bind.

    Delete the PVC and recreate it with values for storage class, access modes and capacity matching those of the PV

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: alpha-pvc
      namespace: alpha
    spec:
      accessModes:
      - ReadWriteMany
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
      storageClassName: local-storage
      volumeMode: Filesystem
    ```

    </details>
    </details>

1.  <details>
    <summary>images</summary>

    * Permitted images are: `docker.io/library/nginx:alpine`, `docker.io/bitnami/nginx`, `docker.io/library/nginx:1.13`, `docker.io/library/nginx:1.17`, `docker.io/library/nginx:1.16` and `docker.io/library/nginx:1.14`. Use `trivy` to find the image with the least number of `CRITICAL` vulnerabilities.

    <details>
    <summary>Reveal</summary>

    1. Inspect all images

        ```
        crictl image ls
        ```

        Note there are additional images other than those stated

    1.  Loop over the images we want (by filtering out those we don't), and trivy them getting the information we need

        ```bash
        for i in $(crictl image -f reference=nginx -o json | jq -r .images[].repoTags[] | grep -v "docker.io/library/nginx:latest")
        do
            echo -n "$i "
            trivy i -s CRITICAL $i 2>&1 | grep Total | awk '{print $2}'
        done
        ```

        We can see that `nginx:alpine` has the least (zero) criticals, which is kind of as expected! We will use this image when we come to deploy the pod later.

    </details>
    </details>


1.  <details>
    <summary>custom-nginx</summary>

    * Move the AppArmor profile `/root/usr.sbin.nginx` to `/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.nginx` on the controlplane node
    * Load the AppArmor profile called `custom-nginx` and ensure it is enforced.

    <details>
    <summary>Reveal</summary>

    1.  ```bash
        mv /root/usr.sbin.nginx /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.nginx
        ```
    1.  ```bash
        apparmor_parser /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.nginx
        ```

    </details>
    </details>

1.  <details>
    <summary>alpha-xyz</summary>

    * Create a deployment called `alpha-xyz` that uses the image with the least 'CRITICAL' vulnerabilities? (Use the sample YAML file located at `/root/alpha-xyz.yaml` to create the deployment. Please make sure to use the same names and labels specified in this sample YAML file!)
    * Deployment has exactly `1` ready replica
    * `data-volume` is mounted at `/usr/share/nginx/html` on the pod
    * `alpha-xyz` deployment uses the `custom-nginx` apparmor profile (applied to container called `nginx`). Note that this task is revealed by clicking the arrow between `custom-nginx` and `alpha-xyz`

    <details>
    <summary>Reveal</summary>


    Edit the given file `/root/alpha-xyz.yaml` and fill in the necessary properties. We need to use the PVC from step 3, the image determined in step 4 and the apparmor profile from step 5

    ```yaml

    ```

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f /root/alpha-xyz.yaml
    ```

    </details>
    </details>

1.  <details>
    <summary>alpha-svc</summary>

    * Expose the `alpha-xyz` as a `ClusterIP` type service called `alpha-svc`
    * `alpha-svc` should be exposed on `port: 80` and `targetPort: 80`

    <details>
    <summary>Reveal</summary>

    ```bash
    kubectl expose deployment alpha-xyz --type ClusterIP --name alpha-svc --port 80 --target-port 80
    ```

    </details>
    </details>

1.  <details>
    <summary>restrict-inbound</summary>

    * Create a NetworkPolicy called `restrict-inbound` in the `alpha` namespace
    * Policy Type = `Ingress`
    * Inbound access only allowed from the pod called `middleware` with label `app=middleware`
    * Inbound access only allowed to TCP port 80 on pods matching the policy
    * Policy should be only applied on pods with label `app=alpha-xyz`. This task is revealed by clicking the arrow between `restrict-inbound` and `alpha-xyz`

    <details>
    <summary>Reveal</summary>

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: restrict-inbound
      namespace: alpha
    spec:
      podSelector:                  # Policy should be only applied on pods with label app=alpha-xyz

                matchLabels:
                  app: middleware
          ports:                    # Inbound access only allowed to TCP port 80 on pods matching the policy
            - port: 80
    ```

    Apply this policy
